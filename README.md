## Data Exploration overview
The guiding question of the entire analysis was how has the Tour changed over time, from there I got into more specific queries. The other explorations were around the different stage types, winners, and distances. Overall trends towards standardization were apparent and it was interesting to see specialist riders become more common over time.
